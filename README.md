## Structure:
- Initialize score and round variables.
- Initalize the function to get computer choice. Use Math.random() to get the computer choice. Get 3 random numbers from math random and associate each number with the 3 choices we have using switch statements.
- Play the game with the input of rounds. If rounds are less than 5 then get both player choices and play the round else print winner.
- Evaluate the choices with switch case, increment the score and print round winner.
- Increment rounds to suggest completion of a round.
- Taking the incremented rounds as input for playGame play the function again.
- Used if else to create a loop and put the game function again at the end of the round func to reevaluate the rounds and keep playing.

## Mistakes/Tips:
- Remember to use the + operator to concatenate the string.
- Try looking for syntax errors in different parts of the line of code.
- Use true in switch expressions in case of multiple expressions.
- If the case in switch case is long or has conditional operators then use brackets around it.
